# SQL-Task3

Task 3 â€“ Querying the Library Database

Objective:
In this task, I wrote SQL queries to practice how to get data from a database.
I learned how to use SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN, AND, OR, and ORDER BY to filter and sort data.

What I Did:

Used SELECT * and selected specific columns

Applied WHERE to filter rows

Used LIKE to search by patterns (like names with "a")

Used BETWEEN to get data between two values

Used AND and OR to combine conditions

Used ORDER BY to sort the results

Queries I Wrote:

Display all books

Find members whose name contains 'a'

Get books published between 1990 and 2010

Show books published before 2000

List members whose email is available

Find members whose name starts with 'A' or email is missing

Show all books sorted by publication year (latest first)

Find books published after 2000 and title contains 'Harry'

Result:
After this task, I understood how to retrieve and filter data from a database using different conditions.
These are basic but important skills used in real-life SQL work. I feel more confident now writing queries on my own.
